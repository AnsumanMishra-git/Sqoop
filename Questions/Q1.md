Q1: Suppose we have a test_db database in mysql. We have an input table Customers inside test_db.  
  
   Cust_Id Customer_Name Purchase_Date Item City Price Cust_Type  
   100 Rishi 2020-08-16 Mobile Kanpur 10000 Regular  
   200 Venu 2019-05-04 Laptop Bangalore 61000 Premium  
   300 Priya 2018-06-25 Mobile Jaipur 20000 Premium  
   400 Rini 2019-01-30 Handbag Pune 1000 Regular  
   700 Deepu 2019-12-12 Appliances Mumbai 25000 Premium  
   
The table has a Primary key on the Price column (which of course is not the right choice as prices may repeat when data grows).  
Display the data present in mysql Customers table.The output of the command should not display on the console, rather should be redirected to a log file named ‘query.output’. Display the contents of the query output file and the output.
