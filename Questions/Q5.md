### Q5. This is an extension of the previous Q4.  
Create a new table in test_db named Categories_new. The command has been shared in mysql_commands text file.  
This newly created table does not have a Primary key. We want to do periodic imports and updates in this mysql table. But we do not want
any duplicate records in the hdfs post import. Also we want to automate the process of import.  

Share the commands you will use when:  
● First time we need to pull all records in hdfs  
● Second time to pull only the delta records,but without duplicates in hdfs  

Share the command you will use to see the last value of a Saved Sqoop Job
